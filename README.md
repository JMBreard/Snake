This is a classic snake game that I created using Java. I followed along with this video until time stamp 29:05 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y62MJny9LHg&t=77s. 
I have never used this Java library before (Java.swing) so I needed help getting the initial setup, but left most of the mechanics up to my own implementation so that I could understand how it works.
Controls for the snake are either WASD or arrow keys. 
Game over is triggered by either going out of bounds or when the snake runs into itself.
The goal is to eat as many "apples", or red squares, as possible.
Score is displayed on gameover screen.
